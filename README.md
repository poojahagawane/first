FEATURE EXTRACTION AND CLASSIFICATION OF GRAMMATICAL FACIAL EXPRESSIONS DATABASE

Abstract
This project implements feature extraction using an extra-trees classifier and is then
classified using two classification techniques such as Logistic Regression and Multi-layer
Perceptron classifier. Here these techniques are applied on two different datasets of person A and
person B having various facial expressions. The training is done on only the 10% part of the person
A dataset and then tested on both the datasets separately. Two datasets used have same dimensions
but different number of instances. Experimental results show the accuracy does not differ much
for classification of the data but the prediction time is highly affected. The prediction time reduces
significantly after the feature extraction process.
